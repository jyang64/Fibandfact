## About

Using a modified bigint class (Russian Multiplication for faster multiplication), the fib source file contains a function that recursively finds the nth Fibonacci number. An unordered map is used to keep track of preciously computed values to speed up computation (memoization).The fact header file contains a template function that finds the factorial of any number type. The modified bigint class was created by my professor.
